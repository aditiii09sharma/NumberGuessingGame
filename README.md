# NumberGuessingGame - Java Project
The "Guess the Number" game is a fun and simple Java project designed to test a player's guessing skills. In this game, the system generates a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100. The player is then prompted to enter their guess in a dialogue box, and the computer responds with feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the correct number.

This project can be enhanced with additional features to make it more engaging:

Limiting the Number of Attempts: Set a maximum number of guesses allowed to add challenge.

Multiple Rounds: Allow players to play multiple rounds to increase the fun.

Score Display: Track and display the player’s score after each round.

Points System: Award points based on the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

With these features, the Number Guessing Game becomes an interactive way to practice programming concepts in Java, like loops, conditionals, and user input handling. It’s a great beginner project to strengthen our Java skills while creating a fun game!
